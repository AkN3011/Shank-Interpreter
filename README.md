# Shank-Interpreter
An interpreter coded in java
Implementation:
 Lexer -  Creates a list of tokens
 Parser -  Parses the list of tokens to form the grammar and syntax for the language. At the end of the process, an AST is generated.
 Interpreter -  The AST generated from parsing is finally used to iterate through and interpret.
